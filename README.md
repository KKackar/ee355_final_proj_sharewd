Summary:
This project works with network management systems using doubly linked list 
data structures. This project has the following files: 
contact.h / contact.cpp, person.h / person.cpp, date.h / date.cpp, 
network.h / network.cpp, misc.h / misc.cpp

The contact files define the Contact class and the subclasses of phone and email. 
It's used to hold the phone and email information. The person files contain details 
about a person such as thei first name, last name, date of birth, and contacts. The date 
files implement the date class when handling date of birth. It ensures they are stored 
in the correct format. The network files manage a doubly linked list of Person objects. 
It supports adding a person at the beginning or end of the list and seaching them by 
first or last name. The misc files contail utility functions for input/output operations
such as printing the banner.
